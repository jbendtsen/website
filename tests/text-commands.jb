|title[ This is an example of a text document |title]
|subtitle[ And this is the sub-title |subtitle]

Here's where the meat of the blog goes. If square brackets or pipes need to be displayed, two can be used in a row, eg. [[like this]] ||or this||.
A single newline is ignored, however two newlines next to each other signify a paragraph break.

This means that this is the start of the second paragraph.
The way styles are incorporated is by specifying when a class is added and when it gets removed,
eg. [italic[italics, [bold[bold (with italics]italic] and without)]bold], [green[ font colours]green].
Code would be quoted as [code-js[var a = 42;]code-js] or

|block code-js[
var a = 42;
if (b < 55) {
	console.log(c);
}

// here's a comment that came after an empty line
|block]

Which would use ||block code-js||. Commands that use pipe characters don't have an ending tag,
and if the command is [c[block]c], then the class stops being applied after the end of the paragraph.
This means a code block can contain square brackets as well as pipe characters that don't need to be escaped,
however an inline code snippet must have its square brackets escaped.
For a syntax-less code snippet/block, [[code[[ or [[c[[ can be used, else a language can be specified with [[code-<lang>[[, eg. [[code-cpp[[.

Any command that contains a number as the second parameter is interpreted as being a block, so a <div> is inserted instead of a <span>.
